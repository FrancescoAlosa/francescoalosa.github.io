I am a postdoctoral researcher in economics at University Paris Dauphine-PSL and a member of the Uppsala Center for Fiscal Studies (UCFS). I received my PhD in July 2024 from the University of Bologna.

I am joining the University of Lisbon-ISEG as an Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) in September 2025. 

**Research areas**: Public Economics and Labour economics, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.
